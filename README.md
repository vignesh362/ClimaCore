# ESG Sensitivity and Local Engagement for Renewable Energy Projects

## Overview
This repository focuses on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) sensitivity and local engagement to evaluate and enhance the success of renewable energy projects. It introduces a dynamic ESG scoring framework and tools to analyze various factors, such as resources, government, location, local sentiment, and future risk analysis.

## Features
- **Dynamic ESG Scoring Framework (1â€“100):**
  - Evaluate projects based on factors like resources, government, and location.
  - Incorporate social media sentiment analysis and economic impact evaluation.
  - Assess biodiversity and soil suitability for project recommendations.

- **Alternative Project Locations:**
  - Identify regions with optimal scores or better project viability.
  - Suggest alternative renewable energy projects based on local conditions.

- **Real-Time Scoring and Monitoring:**
  - Dynamically calculate and update ESG scores based on live data.
  - Provide interactive dashboards for stakeholders.

- **Future Risk Analysis:**
  - Predict potential risks, such as policy changes or environmental degradation.
  - Use machine learning models for forecasting and geospatial analysis for optimization.
